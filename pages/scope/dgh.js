                        “Let us admit it, the settler knows perfectly well that no phraseology can be a substitute for reality”- Frantz Fanon. <br/><br/>
                        In the quest for global health equity, we must introspect and retrospect. We must rethink Education, Partnerships, Opportunities, Finances, Leadership and the Power matrix.  We must enhance our critical thinking and learn from the legacies and ideologies left behind by our predecessors. We must realize and re-examine the colonial legacy of Power and Privilege. Simply we must do better!!!!<br/><br/>
                        In GHYF, we strive to create a safe space for everyone to learn, critic and engage the Decolonial Discourse together. This will be a Youth run Global South movement. If you are someone interested in the decolonial discourse from any walk of life, Contact us to be a part of the Working group and let us break the status quo together.
