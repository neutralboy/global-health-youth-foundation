        We must rethink Education, Partnerships, Opportunities, Finances,
        Leadership and the Power matrix.
        We must enhance our critical thinking and learn from the legacies and
        
        ideologies left behind by our predecessors. We must realize and re-
        examine the colonial legacy of Power and Privilege. Simply we must do
        
        better!!!!
        In GHYF, we strive to create a safe space for everyone to learn, critic
        and engage the Decolonial Discourse together. This will be a Youth run
        Global South movement. If you are someone interested in the decolonial
        discourse from any walk of life, Contact us to be a part of the Working
        group and let us break the status quo together.`,

        about accessible, affordable and sustainable opportunities in the Global South.
        This Comprehensive Community based rural health internship offered by GHYF will include
        concentrations on Rural Health Policy, Advocacy, Health Education, Capacity Development, Program
        Management, Leadership etc.
        While we welcome interns year round, the internships are tailored for the busy schedule of a
        medical/healthcare student. Hence, the interns get to choose between 3 options.
        A two week internship, a month long internship or for a duration of three months with extensions.
        We seek individuals who want to gain work experience and exposure to development in a very rural
        and sometimes challenging setting.These positions offer the opportunity to learn about the inner
        workings of rural health and life all the while being exposed to fundraising, programming, and
        evaluation in areas of rural public health, health education, medicine, women’s rights, and economic
        and community development.
        As GHYF envisions to empower people and communities to eliminate injustices through integrated
        and collaborative efforts in health and development. The internship is not restricted only to healthcare
        majoring students, but instead open to any youth from 18-35 years, from anywhere in the globe.`,

        19, Focusing on
        Disadvantaged Youth`,

        desc: `The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting every aspect of people's lives in an
        unprecedented manner. While many of its implications, such as
        confinement-related psychological distress and social distancing
        measures, affect all of society, different age groups experience these
        impacts in distinct ways. With the gradual transition of government
        responses from immediate crisis management to the implementation of
        recovery measures, several concerns are emerging, such as increasing
        levels of youth unemployment and the implications of rising debt for issues
        of intergenerational justice, as well as
        threats to the well-being of youth and
        future generations. An inclusive
        response to and recovery from the
        crisis requires an integrated approach
        to public governance that anticipates
        the impact of response and recovery
        measures across different age cohorts.
        “Building better” requires decision
        makers to acknowledge generational
        divides and address them decisively in
        order to leave no one behind.The global
        pandemic is also having an
        
        uimpact on education systems all over the world, with far-reaching social
        consequences. According to UNESCO (2020), so far 191 countries have
        implemented nationwide or localized school closures, resulting in over 91 per
        cent of enrolled students, or 1.5 billion people, not being able to go to school .
        These students face disruptions to their education of uncertain duration,
        with varying levels of alternative delivery methods.These disruptions can
        negatively impact learning, access to nutrition, and consequently, graduation
        rates. School closures have a particularly adverse effect on poorer students,
        students without stable internet access
        at home, and children relying on help
        from their schools in meeting their
        nutrition and health needs. The situation
        is especially acute for girls and young
        women who are disproportionately
        excluded from education.Certain
        findings also confirm significant
        psychological impacts of social
        distancing and quarantine measures on
        young people causing stress, anxiety
        and loneliness, while also affirming that
        young adults (aged 18 to 29)
        experience higher level of distress compared to other age groups since the onset of the pandemic. Evidence from previous pandemics suggests that
        exposure to domestic violence increases during lockdown measures, leaving adolescents, children and women vulnerable to violence by family members
        and intimate partners with long-lasting psychological impacts. Vulnerable and marginalised youth are at particular risk of COVID-19 and its impacts.
        Young migrants and refugees, youth living in rural areas, adolescent girls and young women, indigenous and ethnic minority youth, young persons with
        disabilities, young people living with HIV/AIDS, young people of different sexual orientations and gender identities, and homeless youth already
        experience challenges in accessing healthcare services and social protection. Young people with physical or mental health conditions also face an
        elevated risk in relation to COVID-19. Many young people may not have stable housing and therefore cannot safely engage in home-based social
        distancing. The pandemic and economic recession may further fuel stigma and discrimination against certain groups of young people, which in turn would
        further exclude them from accessing healthcare and maintaining their livelihoods.`,
